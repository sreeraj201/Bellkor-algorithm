Also, the tension of integrating\nElisabeth and her children in to the group -- a tension which arises\nsimply\nout of a reluctance to give up any more space to any newcomers -- is\nimportant to the underlying themes in the film. Elisabeth and her children\nbadly need comfort and acceptance, but the children resist this new space\nof\nhippie sharing -- as though they believe it's a fraud in its weirdness\nfor\nthe sake of weirdness. And another area this film explores well within the\ntheme of the individual vs. the group is that of sexual experimentation\nand\npromiscuity. Vital to preserving the group is tolerance of homosexuality\nand\nsexual openness, yet sexuality in a group setting can be as diverse as\neach\nindividual that inhabits the group.

In that regard, Bale nails Connor: intense,\npassionate and dry without an ounce of self-reference or levity.
