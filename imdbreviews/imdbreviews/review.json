{"moviename": ["Free Willy"], "review": [{"fullreview": "\nFirst of all, I want to say some of my thoughts about IMDb ratings. If\nyou look at IMDb top 250 you can hardly find any family movie . In\nfact, there are only three family movie (I mean live action movies not\nanimated flicks) in this chart. They are Princess Bride on the 99\nposition (haven't seen yet), A Christmas Story on 142 (a movie nobody\nheard of besides English speaking countries) and the E.T. on the 244\n(forever classic - no point denying that). And I bet you would be\nunable to find another one even in top 500. On the other hand you can\nfind in this list, for example, more than eighty thrillers or more than\nthirty 30 war movies. Does that result means that family movies can't\nbe good. Obviously it is not. For me the point is that many of people\nas well as lots of critics don't appreciate movies sweet movies without\nprofanity, drugs, sex and violence. Cheesy movie for kids only that's\nnot a fair grade. Well it's only my opinion but for me it's very sad\nwhen such a beautiful movie become so undeservedly underrated. Now,\nmore directly to our movie. I watched Free Willy no less than four or\nfive times and found it one of the best family and animal movie ever\nmade. The bonds of friendship between man and animal are shown\nincredibility well here. From this point Free Willy remembered me\nanother beautiful animal movie The Black Stallion. The unlikely\nfriendship between twelve years old Jesse and giant whale as the main\nelement of the story is very sweet and touching. Overall plot is well\nconstructed (and there's no point to complain its unreality) with\ndecent development of the main characters. Young and definitely\ntalented Jason Jammes Richter created terrific performance of a young\nlonely problem boy Jesse. Also very good in the movie were August\nSchellenberg (as Randolph) and Michael Madsen (as Glen). As I always\nmentioned cinematography is pretty good, including first-rate animal\naction (Keiko is so cute there). The beautiful movie soundtrack written\nby Basil Poleuydouris a bit resembled for me terrific Carmine Coppola's\nscore for The Black Stallion. And finally, that's maybe the most\nimportant Free Willy is a very humanistic movie, a movie that what was\nmade with love and care about nature. Thanks to Simon Wincer for this\ngreat masterpiece. We need more movies like this, not a laughable\nrubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment.

First the titles: The latter one gets right to\nthe\npoint and is intriguing for that; the original has a certain romantic\nappeal, but is sinister behind the pretty sound of it--it portends of dark\n(purple) clouds (of evil) converging upon a bright sunlit horizon.  The\nlatter film has outward homoerotic aspects that is very latent in this\nversion (so much so that those expecting it to be overt will probably not\nnotice--but it had to be given the era in which the movie was released),\nbut\nit's there all right.  Tom is ostensibly supposed to covet Marge, but even\nwhen she's in a scene with him and Phillippe, the tension and electricity\nfairly crackles between the two intense young men, but not with her.\nAnother difference, and I understand the latter version to be faithful to\nthe book in this way, is Marge is not affluent, which rather puts her more\nin Tom's position as she is also at the mercy of Phillippe's money and\nvolatile moods, and that lends another aspect to the film.

Then in 2013, a bizarre discussion on an episode of\nSmith's SModcast podcast hastily inspired him to write and direct Tusk,\na high-concept movie (in more ways than one, I'm sure) that can be\nsummarized with one sentence: Los Angeles podcaster visits Manitoba and\ngets kidnapped by a lunatic who turns him into a walrus. Still with me?\nSmith, during the film's second TIFF screening I attended after its\nworld premiere the night before, joked that he had reached the point in\nhis career where I don't give a fu*k anymore, but just because Smith\nhas reached a bitter crossroads in his career that's resulted in quite\nliterally one of the worst movie experiences I've ever sat through\ndoesn't mean you should also be subjected to the man's lack of impulse\ncontrol.

Johnny Depp shows\nup briefly to chew scenery as Guy Lapointe, a quirky Quebec detective\nconstructed entirely of French-Canadian stereotypes that become\ntiresome very quickly.
